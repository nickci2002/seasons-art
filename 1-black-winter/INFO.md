## main-signs
This is the first event I've ever created. It included:
- A blank background (the base for all event signs)
- Directional/Warning Signs
- Track Number Signs
- A mascot
All future events in TMNF will contain the same format.

## results-banners
In TMNF, there were small banners next to a user's name. They represented accomplishments, complete with a picture and description. The map would have podium awards for:
- Players (people who completed the most maps with the best average map time)
- Mappers (people who had the highest score from a community poll at the end of the event)
