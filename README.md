## Seasons Art
### Overview
Seasons was an event held in Trackmania Nations Forever and TM2020. From December 2023 to January 2025, I was the main art director. The process involved meeting with team members, discussing art ideas/themes, and creating schedules for all members. I would also create the signs displayed on each map.
### Events
These are the following events I've directed, in chronological order:
- Black Winter (TMNF)
- Purple Spring (TMNF)
- Azure Summer (TM2020)
- Brown Autumn (TMNF)
- Onyx Winter (TM2020)
This portfolio only shows the first three events, since I took a step down as leader to focus on my senior year of college.
